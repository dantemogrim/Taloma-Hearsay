## :shipit: About

This is an individual school assignment in PHP where the purpose was to create a news feed with fake news articles. I decided to put my own spin on it and make fun of my own small town upbringing. I decided to go with a made up town name, with made up citizens and write fictional stories based off of true small town gossip culture (as I recall it).
:pencil2: PS. All illustrations are made by me as well.

<details><summary><b>:books:  Required criterias:</b></summary>
The news feed will consist solely of a list of news feed items created by different authors. In total you should have 5 different authors all with at least 2 different news feed items each. The news feed item contents does not have to be logical data so you can use something like lorem ipsum to add some content.

**The news feed items should contain:**

- Title
- Content
- Author
- Published date
- Like counter _(the number of fake likes a news item has received)_

**The news feed author items should contain the following data:**

- ID
- Full name

Both the authors and the news feed items should be stored in arrays in a structure that's simple to use in your code and that's easily understandable. The authors and news feed items don't have to be within the same array but some sort of connection should exist between a news feed item and it's author. The news feed items **should** be ordered based on the published date, so the latest news feed item should go on top and vice versa.

**The project should use the following functionality:**

- Variables
- Multiple data types
- Arrays
- Functions
- Loops (for, while or foreach)
- Output (echo, print etc.)

- The project should be written in HTML, CSS and PHP.
- The project should declare strict types in files containing only PHP code.
- The project should implement an accessible graphical user interface.
- The project should not include any coding errors, warning or notices.
- The project must be tested on at least two of your classmates computers. Add the testers name to the `README.md` file.
- The repository should have at least 10 commits and **not just one big commit**.
- The repository must contain a `README.md` file with installation instructions and documentation.
- The repository must contain a `LICENSE` file.
- The repository must contain a `.editorconfig` file with your preferred settings.
